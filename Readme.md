conda create -p venv python==3.8
```

### Install all necessary librries
```
pip insatll -r requirements.txt
```


### About the project

Imagine you have a dataset where you have predicted loan Eligibility using any

4 different classification algorithms. Now you have to build a model which can

predict loan Eligibility and you need to find the accuracy of the model and built-in

docker and use some library to display that in frontend


### Description

The above dataset get cleaned and preprocessed using label various techniques.

Since from the observation and by doing EDA analysis, its a  supervised machine learning problem so we apply 

Logistic Regression , DecisionTree Classifier, XG-Boost, Random Forest  on the dataset with an accuracy of 96% with Logistic Regression and Decision Tree on hypertuning

The project analysis can be present in a file :

```
EDA.ipynb
```

### Project demo
